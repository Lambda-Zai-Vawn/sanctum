            <p className="text-foreground/80">
                You’ve been taught to chase cash—a depreciating asset issued by systems designed to control you. The SaaS tools you pay for are just digital landlords. This is the "SaaS Trap," and it’s a tax on your ambition. We have severed the leash. ΛΞVON OS operates on **ΞCredits (Ξ)**, the blood of the system and the fuel of automation.

            <p className="text-foreground/80">
                Our economy is a precision-engineered system. The **KLEPSYDRA Engine** governs our economic pulse, architected for profitability and stability. For the Initiate, the **Sine-Rhythm Engine (SRE)** crafts a personal narrative of risk and reward. Every transaction is signed by **Aegis**, making the ledger immutable and the system incorruptible.

                Fuel the **Obelisk of Genesis** with every Ξ spent, etching your legacy into its surface. Wage war on reality in **The Black Wager**, a system-wide ritual to bend the OS to your will. Amass enough power to unlock the final door: **The Grand Transmutation**.
