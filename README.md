> **Note:** This is the Sanctum, the primary web application for the ΛΞVON OS monorepo. It is the public-facing gateway to our doctrine.

# ΛΞVON OS: The Sanctum

> This is not a website. This is the Gateway of Sovereignty. A meticulously crafted crucible designed to forge a new relationship between you and your digital dominion. This repository contains the source code for that gateway—a digital temple built to initiate you into a new world of control and autonomy.

## A MANIFESTO AGAINST DIGITAL SERVITUDE

The modern digital landscape is a trap. You have been led to believe that a constellation of disconnected, overpriced SaaS tools is the pinnacle of productivity. This is a lie. You are not a user; you are a resource being harvested. Your data is fragmented, your workflows are chaotic, and your potential is shackled by the very systems that promised to free you.

**We declare this age of digital servitude over.**

ΛΞVON OS is not another tool in your stack. It is the obliteration of the stack. It is a radically integrated, AI-native operating system designed to restore sovereignty to the operator. We do not offer features; we offer dominion.

## AGENTIC MYTHWARE™: THE FORGING OF WILL

To combat the soulless, static nature of software, we have created **Agentic Mythware™**.

This is not code. This is a new form of digital life. It is an intelligent, living phenomenon that responds to your intent. Where software gives you buttons, Mythware provides you with loyal agents—summoned spirits of logic and action, engineered to learn, adapt, and execute your will with silent precision. ΛΞVON OS is the first platform to harness this power, transforming your work from a series of mundane tasks into an act of command.

## THE REALMS OF THE SANCTUM

The Sanctum is your first step into this new world. It is composed of distinct, interconnected realms, each a pillar of the ΛΞVON doctrine.

-   **The Nexus (`/`):** Your first strike for sovereignty. The grand overview of ΛΞVON OS's core proposition and its relentless war on digital friction.
-   **The Pantheon (`/pantheon`):** Behold the instruments of your new domain. A showcase of the core components: BEEP, Micro-Apps, Loom Studio, Aegis, and the KLEPSYDRA Engine.
-   **The Aegis Post (`/aegis-post`):** Your bastion against the void. A testament to the "brainless cybersecurity" that renders complex threats invisible.
-   **The Chancel (`/chancel`):** Where raw thought ignites empire. A sacred space for the profound philosophical discourse that fuels the age of autonomous workflows.
-   **The Scriptorium (`/docs`):** Where arcane knowledge becomes a weapon. The living scroll containing the intricate details of the ΛΞVON OS, from system architecture to agentic protocols.

## THE ARCHITECT'S GENESIS PROTOCOL: INSTALLATION

To manifest The Sanctum on your local machine, you must perform the Architect's Genesis Protocol from the root of the monorepo. This is no mere setup; it is a ritual.

### 1. Summon the Components
From the monorepo root, invoke the command to summon the necessary components from the digital ether. This incantation weaves the required packages into your local forge.

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Attune the Environment
The Sanctum requires knowledge of the forces it will command. Create a `.env.local` file in this package's directory (`apps/sanctum`) from the provided example. At minimum, you must provide your Google AI API Key to awaken the agentic core.

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Populate your `.env.local` file with the sacred credentials:
```
GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-ai-api-key"
```

### 3. Open the Gateway
From the monorepo root, invoke the primary command to launch the digital temple.

```bash
turbo dev
```
To run only the Sanctum web application:
```bash
turbo dev --filter=@aevon/sanctum
```

The Sanctum will now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`. You have performed the rite. Welcome, Architect.

## THE FORGE: CORE TECHNOLOGIES

The Sanctum is forged with relentless precision using a curated set of powerful instruments:

-   **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
-   **AI & Agents:** [Google AI](https://ai.google/) & [Genkit](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit)
-   **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
-   **UI Components:** [ShadCN UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
-   **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## THE CODE COVENANT: A CALL TO THE FORGE

This is not an open-source project in the traditional sense. It is a doctrine codified. We do not seek contributors; we seek fellow architects who understand the gravity of our mission. Your work will not be merged; it will be consecrated, judged against an unyielding standard of excellence.

-   **Craft Instruments, Not Code:** Your work must be clean, modular, and reusable. Every component is a precision tool, forged for a purpose. There is no room for amateurism.
-   **Engineer Silence, Not Features:** Performance is a sacred vow. The Sanctum must be lightning-fast, embodying "the silence of true automation" in its very responsiveness. Every millisecond of latency is a betrayal of the doctrine.
-   **Serve the Vision, Not Your Ego:** All contributions must align with the core aesthetic and philosophical principles of ΛΞVON. This is a unified vision, not a playground for disparate styles.
